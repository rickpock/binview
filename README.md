# BinView

BinView is a library to interpret the contents of binary files.

BinView represents the file contents hierarchically. The entire file is the root of the tree, and sections can be broken down recursively.

This is currently in a prototype stage, meaning that the architecture is being explored and subject to change at any time.

# Vision

The project is planned as a library, allowing it to be used in any hex viewer or IDE. The file parsing is intended to be extensible, allowing multiple contributors to add their own file parsers.
